“刷题”对于每一名计算机专业的学生而言无疑是重要的，不仅它可以扎实学生的编程基础，而且面试企业工作首先就要用题来考查面试者。但是目前市面上的在线评测系统大多存在着一定的缺陷，由于采用集中评测制，不能良好的应对不定期的大流量评测事件，例如举办特定的比赛。此外，该类系统的功能大多单一，用户在实现刷题后很难与其他用户进行交流心得，或是发布自己的教程。为此我们提出了基于Electron-Vue+Gin框架的轻量级、分布式、All-in-one的分布式综合性学习平台。本系统内置了相当多的题目供用户作答。由于采用了分布式部署的策略，评测阶段将会在客户端运行，用户仅需将评测结果上传至云端，相较于传统评测系统大大增加了系统的并发量。可以良好的应对各种大型比赛活动的评测。此外，为了增加用户之间的知识共享，我们还设置了讨论区与教程区，用户可以在里面自由发表观点与对题目的建议互相讨论题目，并在教程区发表一系列教程来发表自己对于某一块知识的理解供其他用户交流学习。

\chapter*{Abstract}


"Coding" for every computer major students is undoubtedly important, not only it can solid programming foundation of students, but also the interview of enterprise work must first use the question to examine the interviewer.  However, most of the online evaluation systems on the market have some defects. Because of the centralized evaluation system, they can not cope with the irregular large-scale evaluation events, such as holding specific competitions.  In addition, most of the functions of this system are single, so it is difficult for users to communicate with other users or publish their own tutorials.  Therefore, we propose a lightweight, distributed, all-in-one distributed comprehensive learning platform based on the Electron-Vue+Gin framework.  This system has built in quite a number of questions for users to answer.  Due to the distributed deployment strategy, the evaluation phase will run on the client side, and users only need to upload the evaluation results to the cloud, which greatly increases the concurrency of the system compared with the traditional evaluation system.  Can deal with the evaluation of various large-scale competition activities.  In addition, in order to increase knowledge sharing among users, we also set up discussion area and tutorial area, where users can freely express their views and suggestions on topics and discuss topics with each other, and publish a series of tutorials in the tutorial area to express their understanding of a certain piece of knowledge for other users to exchange and learn.
