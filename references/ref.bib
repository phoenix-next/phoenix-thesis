abstract = {An OJ (Online Judge) system is a web software for compiling, executing and evaluating programs submitted by users. OJ systems were originally used in programming competitions. Since systems are high-efficiency and suitable for different-level programming learners, they are widely used in programming education at present. We have developed an OJ system and applied it to the course of Programming in C language since the year of 2007. We found that the system did help improve the programming ability of students. However, a traditional OJ system still has some shortcoming for programming education, such as it grade programs only based on the number of test cases passed, regardless of the code quality of programs. In this paper, we propose the framework of a novel OJ system for programming education. The new OJ system contains four modules: personalized feedback for students, code quality checking, code similarity checking, and advising on teaching adjustment.},
